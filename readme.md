## About the Project

![Screenshot of the project](screenshot.png)

This project has been focused to learn some new cool techniques programming in JavaScript ES6. The purpose is to learn more in depth the new functionalities of ECMA script v6 and enjoying to develop a classic videogame to make this a fun learning thing!

This project uses a full HTML/CSS aproximation and I've not used any canvas to draw the tetrominoes.

**Notes**

> ATENTION: This web browser-game is not responsive. It was not intended to play in a mobile device.

> The code contains Spanish comments to understand its functionality.

### Project Structure

The project has been developed with a classic folder distribution:

- **css**: all the styles of the project are inside this folder.
- **js**: The important file is located here. I've developed the _app.js_ taking in mind a MVC aproximation.
- _index.html_: our web browser-game. Just HTML code.

### Instructions

To play this Tetris version game, you need to play it on a desktop or laptop web browser. To start a game, click on _New Game_ button in the right side. The game will start inmediately. Game will Over if the tetrominoes block will reach the top of the panel.

### Controls

- :arrow_left:: move left the current tetrominoe.
- :arrow_right:: move right the current tetrominoe.
- :arrow_up:: turn the current tetrominoe.
- :arrow_down:: move down the current tetrominoe.

- Push the _spacebar_ or click the _New Game_ button to restart a new game.
